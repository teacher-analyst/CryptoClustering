# CryptoClustering - Unsupervised Learning 
This project is part of Module 19 Challenge of the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

### Files supplied
 - Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb
 - Resources folder containing csv file 

### Deliverables
1. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using originalscaled data
2. Optimise clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3. Create composite plots and answer the question 'What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?'.
